Welcome to my profile!

Currently I am mainly interested in [matrix](https://matrix.org/) and the [matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/). Focused on contributing to open source project surrounding matrix in my free time. My main goal is to make it easier to deploy and administer a software stack to utilise the matrix protocols and to make the transition from proprietary communications platforms to a self-hosted software stack based on matrix easier.

Other than that, I'm currently really interested in different web technologies and frameworks, mainly about real time web applications and offline applications. Heres a list of links:

- [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
- [Socket.io framework](https://socket.io/)
- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/)
- [Yjs framework](https://github.com/yjs/yjs)
- [Service Worker API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)

[Open an issue here](https://github.com/dominiwe/dominiwe/issues/new) if you want to communicate with me or ask me something.
