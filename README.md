Welcome to my profile!

Currently I am mainly interested in [matrix](https://matrix.org/) and the [matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/). Focused on contributing to open source project surrounding matrix in my free time. My main goal is to make it easier to deploy and administer a software stack to utilise the matrix protocols and to make the transition from proprietary communications platforms to a self-hosted software stack based on matrix easier.

Other than that, I am interested in real time web applications using technologies like the [WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) and [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) and frameworks like [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/).

[Open an issue here](https://github.com/dominiwe/dominiwe/issues/new) if you want to communicate with me or ask me something.
