Welcome to my profile!

Currently I am mainly interested in [matrix](https://matrix.org/) and the [matrix specification](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/). Focused on contributing to open source project surrounding matrix in my free time. My main goal is to make it easier to deploy and administer a software stack to utilise the matrix protocols and to make the transition from proprietary communications platforms to a self-hosted software stack based on matrix easier.
